He is just worthless employee, who don\u2019t even listen my query. Only he knew one word \u201C I am Sorry Sir\u201D. Pathetic service from logistic and customer care team of Shopzilla; It is nearly 13 days still we have not received our grocery products and not even able to cancel it. You have the most worst customer service. Even from there side also they are not able to cancel the product and giving us fake assurance that these product will come everytime whenever we call. Please refund my money and you have compensate as well for this much day delay in delivery. I dont have words to tell that how pathetic your service is. And also your customer support executives are giving false commit to connect with the higher authority and leaving the headphones."

Thank you sir; I purchased a chimney from Shopzilla on 2nd Aug costing Rs 12999 and after applying offer it costed me Rs 11749. On checking the same product on 4th Aug it is now showing the price of Rs 11599 and if i apply the offer on it then it would cost me Rs 9917. So the product which got me delivered had a price decrease of the same product is costing Rs1832 less. This is utter disappointing. If the decrease is a week later when a customer purchases a product its okay but within a span of 2 days it decreased , the seller should refund the decreased amount.; Your executive was rude"
Brandon Leon,"Please give access to customer executive for logistics... Very bad..... So much annoying; Your services are getting worse with every passing day, specially your logistics services are pathetic, they don't bother to even respond to the customers call, they never share an update about the delivery if there is any delay only the customer needs to put an effort and reach to customer service team and deal with dum people who don't understand anything and keep on repeating the same lines again and again. Improve your services, if you really want to work on your service team listen to my last call.; Customer service executive cut call without resolve my issue.; Customer care executive response was excellent ; On 24 AUGUST customer care executive said that pickup will done today or tomorrow but next day morning msg received that pickup was cancelled.

He is gentle and very polite and tried to understand my problem. Thanks to him for his efforts and he resolved my problem.; Services must be customer friendly. Its not the responsibility of customer to talk to the seller for any issues, it should be resoved by Shopzilla itself as there is no meaning to communicate to seller as the product purchased from Shopzilla. I talked to the HAVELLS company as per Shopzilla request regarding my latest product replacement/exchange, they told me talk to Shopzilla and we are not responsible for anything as you baught it from them. "
Brandy Shea,"The representative I spoke with was very kind and very informative and resolved my query soon. Please hire more customer support executive like him.

Brian Wall,Executive failed to answer my 2-3 pointed question as he was interested to justify his own words again and again; My question no result and phone drop customer care not call again me; Reaching out to support is very cumbersome. The chatbot don't resolve any issues that works based on key words only. Though in chats it is mentioned that u will Regards connect again if the call gets disconnected but same never happens.Further how can it be that the other mediums of communication with the customer care is wiped off. Only chatbot assistant is available.Really very sad to see the care of such a good org for the CUST O MER issue resolution.

I need my refund money asap; Rather then customer service..if the logistics reach out needs to be improved...everytime a customer calls the logistics number which we recieve through a sms it says busy; Issue not resolved.

They mentally harsh me since last 9 days . Don't believe   . ; Some Shopzilla delivery boys are scammer and some  customer care executives are really useless.Please improve your services. Other wise you lost your customers "
Carla Morgan,"Customer support executive was really polite and solved my payment related query asap.I am happy with Shopzilla Customer service ?? ; it was nice talking to you; The connection between Shopzilla and Shopzilla is nil. Even a small logistics company has proper tracking mechanism and complaint answering mechanism. If something is delivered through Shopzilla, Shopzilla doesn't have any contact details. For open box delivery someone should be there at that place and Shopzilla doesn't promise any date or time of delivery. So if we order something, we should avoid all personal task and wait for that parcel and the worst part is, it gets delayed further again.Please have little responsibility atleast ; Executive answered my questions patiently and very clearly; Customer service is very good and very well understand all our things and very quickly whatever issue we have, they solve it easily.; very good person ; The customer care sir is very good nature he resolved all the problems so thank you so much "

Cathy Harris,"Thanks for the executive for timely resolving problem.; Customer support executive misguided me that's why my refund not received and they provide me wrong information all time; Nice service by executive; Direct customer care no. And mail id for Shopzilla, it takes hours to arrange call back on chat, also it took 10 incomplete calls before the final call; Please remove return/exchange fees  for plus members atleast as we shop alot so some products may need to be returned or exchange due to sellers fault or size issue. Please don't charge your valuable customers for return/exchange as no other website or app does that. If Shopzilla continues to do this then  you will simply lose your valuable customers as they will switch to other websites/apps where there is no return/exchange fees and can shop securely without having the second thought of losing out their hard earn money."
Chad Burns,Agent has to address customer issue and resolve it.. instead of providing unethical reasons; Happy with Shopzilla customer service !! ??Hope my problem will resolve as soon as possible.; Very good ?? Shopzilla service agent nice ?? I am happy
Chad Daniel,Good support of customer careThanks
Chad Nielsen,"One month have passed and customer support executive taken long time and today finally they are saying that you have to clear your paylater dues amount while I have already paid and details also shared. Very bad experience.and I am unable to place new order also because it's got cancelled .; This feedback is not only for this time, this feedback goes for every person those who are communicate with me for this case and also the delivery executive.

Charles Morales,Too much your serviceVery very wrong information by your staff 
Charles Nelson,Good talk with customer care ??
Charles Williamson,I am very disappointed with Shopzilla.The issue was not resolved.The customer care executive was polite enough though he was not able to resolve the issue.But I am appalled at the utter lack of responsibility and accountability of Shopzilla in providing tracking services.; An agent named Azhar try to help me out but system does allow him to proceed further.  nice customer support.
Charlotte Jacobs,"Return request is accepted( 3 times in my case) but then seller cancels request- as as per seller it was open box delivery but in fact the wishmaster didn't inform me about OBD. I have video proof of that as well call recording. Gave all information to customer care executive so twice my return request was initiated but cancelled again. I have g9t used, damaged, old product which may have been manufactured 5-10 yrs back, as there is no tag. This is not expected from Shopzilla ( most trusted and reputed online shopping website).; Agent is very patient to solve the problem and I appreciate her work.

The exact issue about my order delivery is still unknown, even the customer care employees don't know what actually the problem is. What exactly could be the problem when the order is out for delivery!!??? Atleast give a proper and a clear reason for the delay of the order. And please make sure to contact the customer about such issues beforehand. The customer shouldn't be troubled to contact your team.I am still not satisfied with the reason explained by the customer care service. But whatsoever, kindly resolve my issue asap."
Christina Bolton,Poor n worthless policies. In my experience i got multiple time damage priduct or wrong product or missing product. Secondly Shopzilla didnt provide sellers contact detail they only share their address then how come posdible to contact them? And most irritating return policy 50 rs penulty for any reason? Why? N howcome?? Is customers satisfaction had no value for Shopzilla? Their time from order to product to recieve n if anything wrong then return is so messy n irritating. No flexibility. I want to say improve custome relationship Shopzilla n better u go. Just tired to their service now. ; Worst customer service executive ever ; I like executive support ever; Your policy is seller friendly not buyer friendly .In no return product seller send any garbage  but no one to listen buyer problem.

I didn't received the product inspite of so many calls to customer care.... I got cheated by Shopzilla seller... I loss the amount and I didn't received any product... It's disheartening and pathetic service from Shopzilla... U lost a valuable customer and I am not going to order anything in th future from Shopzilla... SuperBuy service to its customers is far better that Shopzilla.... They take there customers seriously but Shopzilla plays with money and time of customers and I ll make sure that no one from my surroundings and known persons get cheated in future so I will surely suggest them don't order from Shopzilla.... It's service, seller, customers care all are pathetic.... Do check the review also how u all make fool out of me.... But since it's my hard earned money and u all cheated it's more awful and pathetic to further have account in your  "
Christine Gray,"Executive is good.

Christine Lewis,"Customer care   bahut acche se bat kiye I am happy ; This is a genuine feedback for Shopzilla and not for agent who interacted with me. She was good, understanding, polite and helpful. She did whatever she could do.Looks like backend complaint was raised and I was promised a resolution by 30th  which never happened.This is not the first time happened with me and looks like this is now becoming a regular problem with Shopzilla. I had another bad experience like this couple of months ago when I ordered a cooler.I think something is going wrong here which you guyz needs to figure out before it becomes serious problem.Thank you"

Jacob Hester,"I am writing this feedback with immense frustration and disappointment over the abysmal customer service experience I encountered while dealing with one of your agents. It is truly disheartening to see a company of your stature fail so miserably in resolving simple customer issues and providing basic information.Let me begin by stating that I had a rather straightforward inquiry regarding a recent purchase, but dealing with your agent has been nothing short of a nightmare. The agent I interacted with displayed a complete lack of knowledge and understanding of the issue at hand. It seemed as if they were either inadequately trained or simply uninterested in assisting me.Not only was the agent unable to provide any useful information, but their attitude was also dismissive and unprofessional. They showed no empathy towards my concerns and treated my problem as insignificant, which is deeply distressing as a loyal customer of Shopzilla.It is quite disconcerting that such incompetence exists within your customer service team, especially considering that customer support should be the backbone of any successful business. The lack of proper training and guidance is evident, and it reflects poorly on Shopzilla's commitment to customer satisfaction.Moreover, the agent's failure to resolve the issue only exacerbated my frustration. It is absurd that despite multiple attempts to seek assistance, I am still left in the dark without any resolution. I expected a much higher level of service from a reputed company like Shopzilla, and I feel utterly let down.This experience has not only wasted my time but also tarnished my perception of Shopzilla as a reliable e-commerce platform. It's clear that the company needs to invest significantly in improving its customer service processes and ensuring that its agents are adequately equipped to handle customer queries and issues effectively.I am seriously contemplating whether I should continue using Shopzilla for my future purchases, as this unpleasant experience has eroded my trust in your brand. I sincerely hope that this feedback will serve as a wake-up call for Shopzilla to take immediate action in rectifying its customer service shortcomings.In conclusion, I urge Shopzilla to address this matter urgently and implement measures to ensure that such appalling customer service is not repeated in the future. As a loyal customer, I deserve better treatment, and I hope Shopzilla can live up to the expectations it has set for itself.; Customer care was very good "

Executive wasted my precious time and of the Shopzilla company also. ; Wrong information is given by customer service ; Your executive end the call during conversation.

He also loed on the recorded line that they do not have the option to transfer the call his name was Chandar Parkash I don't think he gave me the correct name. Third agent was polite but had no ownership of the call and took 7 minutes to check with the available resources to help me which wasted my time.Shopzilla is really a terrible company. ; Executive disconnected my call 3 times without resolving issue; Remove bad sellers from Shopzilla platform ; Your seller are cheating your customers.you should improve the satisfaction of your customers

I'm facing the issue since 05 months and Shopzilla not issue the refund of my product as order cancelled by Shopzilla Executive.; Remove fake sellers from Shopzilla
Melissa Spence,"Shopzilla's customer care service is good for nothing. The idea is to defend the indefensible. Simply, parroting that cancellation of order was from the seller and there is no way to restore it again is absolutely undesirable and frivolous behaviour. The pricing of the said item at a special price of Re.1/- was based on the condition of a minimum purchase amount. So, how can Shopzilla shirk it's responsibility by saying that the cancellation was from the seller due to quality issues when it is very evident that the act is malafide and with a cheating motive. Why was the item not part of the rest of the order? Why was I delivered  part of the order conducive to the seller and the other part shown as available in the nearest hub. I would have exercised the option of returning the whole order. Importantly, my transaction has been with Shopzilla and it should take responsibility for such arbitrary and malafide cancellation. You should be concerned about your own goodwill and put an end to such incidents. The onus is on Shopzilla to maintain the sanctity of the transaction by ensuring the delivery of the said item. Wrong things keep happening but you should be fair in resolving a genuine grievance of a customer. Please look at your competitors like SuperBuy and Jio Mart for inspiration. I can share with you instances on how well they address customer grievances, with documentary proof. Hope to see a resolution to the long pending complaint by escalation of the issue to the right team since the team handling it till now has been a big dissapoinment. Just for information, such complaints are easily handled by the first level in the above mentioned e-commerce sites.; Need to educate the Frontline support executive because there is a lack of knowledge about the application ; The customer care support executive was very polite and she understood my query very well and she assured me that your problem will be resolved "
Melissa Taylor,"Please educate sellers to pack food & non food products separately as this is not as per customer requirements & not a healthy sign of consuming food products ??; Customer care was very polite and very helpful; Takes too much time to contact with the Shopzilla executive. Contacting to Shopzilla customer support should be made user friendly. If there is no return policy for any product, Shopzilla must assure to get right product delivered to the customer. As if wrong product is delivered, it's difficult to contact Shopzilla support."

Michelle Whitehead,"Nice support staff; Your Customer service is in negatives man. You got to work on your product quality too. I never liked your service anyday. It's for my friend and so, I extended my hand to help. All I wanted was to change address and contact number. It was available but was not functioning since the order was placed. If you still see no problem, hear me out... I called for an English Executive and guy starts communicating in Hindi. That too is fine by me. But here's the best part of all. As soon as I discuss my concern to change contact number and Address for the same order. He denies. And suddenly no options are available or no where to be seen. What a cheap stunt is that ? If you can't manage your customers, then, why to bother them at all.

In case of customer service executive I would give 5 star rating for helping me.Thank you.; On 4th of August 3 products from Colour Duva were delivered and  all of them were cheaper range of product from the same company and did not resemble the product description or the image shared on the app.   was not even delivered. Packet only had eyeliner. I had raised the issue many times with Shopzilla but no redressal has been given. 3 or 4 times the call from Shopzilla was received but nobody spoke and the call got disconnected and without even talking to me the case was marked resolved. Now I am stuck up with the products which I cannot use ,cannot return nor can order another one. Please look into the matter immediately. This complain is not just for this one product but all three product delivered by COLOUR DIVA on 4th August. This is sure case of cheating the customer. They mark the product as non returnable and then send any garbage and Shopzilla cannot wash their hands off by saying that it is 'a non returnable product' since you have taken the responsibility of the company who sells with you. Had such a thing happened with me on SuperBuy I would be asked not to send the product back and an immediate refund would have been issued. You need to address this issue immediately and offer satisfying redressal; Good person; Everyone talks very nicely; I call your supporter executive 4 times but the disconnected my calls so at last I was able to call from him .

I don't know what she understood, I hang up the phone. Shopzilla manager / Team- Plz let me know sometimes the product size is not okay as per the given chart in the Shopzilla website. Plz provide authorization to customer executive to deal with the delivery hub / delivery vendor. Literally it took nearly a month to get my exact size product, Try to understand - customer can't buy - 2 different size product at a time in order to check which one gonna fit? So we order right size according to chart, still face issue, thn we think might be one smaller size would be best for us, unfortunately it's too small for us then after testing, we want our original product back bcz we love the design of clothes, somehow there is no such option in Shopzilla website where I can exchange with same size, We return product in afternoon, but somehow came to know it's not fit, then the product which I had returned, I want that same product, Plz make comfortable to customer by placing option to return size, and also there is no connection between delivery man & customer So worst for customer satisfaction, Now to get same product, again I have to place order, it gonna take time of 6 day So HARASSMENT to Shopzilla customer with such big so called Shopzilla Brand - I'm the Shopzilla plus ?customer I'm the fan of Shopzilla quality products but plz do some changes as per thousands customer requirements U r running the business then keep ur website and ideas updated..

Olivia Villa,"I ordered a new phone using exchange offer of old phone. Was given better exchange price than other sites and hence ordered on Shopzilla. On day of exchange, figured out what scam Shopzilla is using to sell their products.My old phone went through rigorous inspection by the delivery agent. He first damaged and removed my costly screen guard. Then checked phone every minute area. There was no issue and i was expecting this only as my phone was just a year old. Then to my surprise, he said my phone is bent out of no where. Was hard for me to accept this but he straight away said amount will be deducted for this defect of you want to still exchange for new phone.I have the video also on how he checked phone bent and will be escalating this.But ultimately I got same amount which other sites were giving. Shopzilla is just running a scam to boost sales. I am sure no one would have been able to get full exchange amount with the way their exchange policy is.Was completely fooled by them. ; When I spoke to customer care before it's showing me 20 of aug after speak to him now it's showing 22 of august dnt knw he solve my issue r create more issue  and dnt understood what   telling if I dnt get by tomorrow r 22nd I will cancel the order and I will uninstall the app bcz it's getting many times to mew"

I need compensation for the damages done by you.; Please make the process easy So that customer can easily reach to the customer service executive through call.
Rachel Green,If a delivery agent didnt contaceted customer and he himself says that customer rejected the product qnd cancelled the order placed without reaching customer is highly unethical and these delivery agent are giving false statment on customers.

Savannah Keller,"I have multiple issues with the product  "" ordered on 02-08-2023 and delivered to me on 07-08-2023 as follows:- 1) the product is not as shown in the photos on Shopzilla app Page2) the product is shorter than the dimensions mentioned on the app Page.3) the quality of the product is very poor and the thread count is very low the bedsheet is thin and like a net.When I called the customer service on Shopzilla on 09-08-2023 and mentioned the above problems and requested for a return and refund,the executive was not at all able to solve my issue. I faced the following problems during my call with the executive:-1) she was not able to communicate effectively either in Hindi or in English, nor did she understand my issue.2) instead of raising a return and refund request, she raised a replacement request by default WITHOUT MY CONSENT, and when I asked her why she did so, she said that I will have to cancel the replacement on my own and then again call the customer care for placing return request.3) more than one hour of my precious time was wasted during this single call, and I did not receive any assistance. I was unnecessarily harassed and my issue was not resolved.4) because of this I am left with this totally unacceptable product, and cannot raise a return request.Such unprofessional and unethical behaviour on the part of a reputed website like Shopzilla is not at all acceptable. I am very disappointed and exhausted with trying to get a return and refund, when it is clearly promised on the product page on Shopzilla for this particular item, and when I am within the return period.I am sorry to state that I will not consider Shopzilla for any further buying in future, and will resort to buying from other reliable websites like SuperBuy or Reliance.Thank you for such a bad experience on Shopzilla.Regards,Extremely disappointed Long time Shopzilla Plus Customer.; Customer care cut my call "

Scott Pierce,"Now this has become really frustating! I am being asked to upload the images again for return which will be the 4th time! That too without any reason apart from saying images could not be validated! I have provided the images in the best possible quality and in the required format covering all the details as requested! If this is the quality of your service then its really sad to say that I will not be using your platform any further nor will I advice anyone close to me to use it quoting this exact scenario. Here are the images for one last time (though I know it will still be rejected without giving any valid reason apart from it could not be validated, as you guys do not intend to return the product. Also the status saying that this product was opened at the time of delivery is incorrect as the courier person had delivered the product in a brown sealed outer box, which I opened afterwards. I have a camera installed at my gate and have video proof to validate it. Can be shared if you provide another medium as it cannot be attached here! Also if it was opened at the time of delivery then please ask the courier person to show the image as proof which I am sure is a mandate to take while transferring the product (which he cannot provide as the product was delivered in a sealed box). If this is the case when ordering a 1500 rupees product, who will ever have the confidence of ordering a higher value product from your platform. I did not want to write such harsh feedback for you, but you have compelled me to do so by making me go through so many calls to explain the same thing to atleast 6-7 people and sending the same details again and again. Other platforms like SuperBuy and Tata clique are way better in this regard!"

Really nice; On 4th of August 3 products from Colour Duva were delivered and  all of them were cheaper range of product from the same company and did not resemble the product description or the image shared on the app.   was not even delivered. Packet only had eyeliner. I had raised the issue many times with Shopzilla but no redressal has been given. 3 or 4 times the call from Shopzilla was received but nobody spoke and the call got disconnected and without even talking to me the case was marked resolved. Now I am stuck up with the products which I cannot use ,cannot return nor can order another one. Please look into the matter immediately. This complain is not just for this one product but all three product delivered by COLOUR DIVA on 4th August. This is sure case of cheating the customer. They mark the product as non returnable and then send any garbage and Shopzilla cannot wash their hands off by saying that it is 'a non returnable product' since you have taken the responsibility of the company who sells with you. Had such a thing happened with me on SuperBuy I would be asked not to send the product back and an immediate refund would have been issued. You need to address this issue immediately and offer satisfying redressal; Customer care support se baat karke achha   best behaviour for customerThank you so much.."

Tony Jones,": Unresolved Issue and Formal NoticeDear Sir/Madam, I am writing to bring to your attention the ongoing issue I have been facing with my recent purchase from Shopzilla. My order was placed on 15th of July, and since then, I have been diligently trying to connect with your customer service team every 3rd day in an attempt to resolve the matter, but to no avail.The timeline provided by the service team for resolution is not acceptable to me, and it has caused undue inconvenience and distress. I have already submitted the DOA certificate from an authorized   service station, along with a photo after packing the faulty laptop, on 31st August. The customer service team assured me that I would receive an update within 24 to 48 hours. However, to my disappointment, there has been no response or progress in resolving my issue since then.I demand a new replacement laptop to be delivered to me within the next 24 to 48 hours. In the event that your company is unable to adhere to this reasonable timeline, I request that you promptly inform me of the same. If my issue remains unaddressed and unattended, I have no choice but to resort to legal action by submitting a complaint to the consumer court.; Thank you so much customer care "

My return order needs to be picked up many days ago but neither call nor product has been picked up till now.
