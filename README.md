# DS-Consulting-Capstone-Project
Capstone project for the Data Science Consultancy class. The primary aim of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of customer satisfaction surveys to understand the customer service experience at Shopzilla. We will examine both qualitative and quantitative aspects of customer feedback to determine the factors that impact customer satisfaction. The insights derived from this analysis will enable us to identify improvement areas and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the overall customer experience.

To obtain the data used in the Power BI report, run scripts in the following order:
1. ```scripts/get_sentiment.py```
2. ```scripts/filter_agent_feedback.py```
3. ```scripts/get_word_frequencies.py```
